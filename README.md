This project focuses on understanding the causes and likelihood of a diabetes diagnosis through the lens of machine learning. I used PCA, K-means, and Gaussian mixture model algorithms to predict diabetes diagnoses with the Pima Indians Diabetes Database dataset and compared the accuracy of both models on raw data and PCA data. Modeled results.
